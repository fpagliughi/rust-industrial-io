# GitHub Actions CI check for the 'industrial-io' Rust crate
#
# It does the following:
# - Format check of the sources using nightly
# - Build check using the current stable compiler and the MSRV version.
# - Clippy check using the MSRV compiler
#
# Note that the current MSRV predates the new cargo resolver, v3, so we go
# out of or way to use it from stable to create a Cargo.lock file that 
# properly resolves dependencies for the MSRV.
#
# Note that the unit tests currently won't work without the 'industrialio'
# and 'iio_dummy' modules, loaded into the kernel. So for now, they're 
# commented out. We'll try to figure out how to load them, but if that
# doesn't work, perhaps can split out a default set of tests that don't
# hit the kernel and at least run those.
